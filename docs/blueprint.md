## Core Features:

- Target Input & Consent: Accepts target IP/hostname input and requires explicit user consent via checkbox before initiating any scans.
- Passive Data Gathering: Collects passive data such as DNS records (A, AAAA, MX, NS), reverse DNS, WHOIS lookup, and GeoIP information. Use a tool to validate if the host responds to pings.
- Active Probes: Performs TCP connect scans on a configurable set of common ports (e.g., 22, 80, 443, 3306, 3389) and grabs banners, HTTP headers and response statuses where available.
- Risk Assessment and Reporting: Analyzes scan results, assesses risk level per finding, and generates a concise report.
- Results Dashboard: Displays scan results in a consolidated dashboard with sections for each type of information.
- Scan History: Logs all scan actions, including timestamps and user information, for audit purposes.
- Terms Check: Clear terms checkbox that validates permission to scan target. Logs all actions and can perform rate-limiting to prevent abuse.
